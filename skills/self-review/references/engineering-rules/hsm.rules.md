# HSM-BASE-001 MUST Apply Host-Language And HSM Pattern Rules

See:
- [PAT-HSM-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-hsm-001-must-explicit-hierarchical-state-modeling)

HSM code MUST comply with the relevant host-language rules and hierarchical state machine pattern rules.

Host-language aliases MUST map directly to canonical HSM semantics and MUST NOT introduce separate behavior.

# HSM-INIT-001 MUST Define Initial Transitions

See:
- [PAT-HSM-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-hsm-001-must-explicit-hierarchical-state-modeling)

Every model and composite state that enters a nested substate MUST define an explicit initial transition.

Initial transitions MUST target nested states and MUST NOT use guards.

# HSM-STRUCT-001 MUST Keep State And Transition Declarations Valid

Transition fields such as source, target, trigger, guard, and effect MUST be declared in transition definitions.

State behavior such as entry, exit, activity, and defer MUST be declared in state definitions.

# HSM-FINAL-001 MUST Keep Final States Terminal

Final states MUST NOT define outgoing transitions, activities, entry actions, or exit actions.

# HSM-HISTORY-001 MUST Provide History Fallbacks

History pseudostates MUST live inside composite states.

History pseudostates MUST provide explicit fallback transitions for first-time re-entry.

# HSM-EVENT-001 MUST Use Explicit Triggers

See:
- [PAT-EVENT-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-event-001-must-typed-event-boundaries)

Every HSM transition MUST have an explicit trigger where the HSM API requires triggers.

String wildcards and implicit completion progression are forbidden unless modeled by the framework as explicit events.

# HSM-SCHEMA-001 MUST Define Event Payload Contracts

See:
- [PAT-EVENT-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-event-001-must-typed-event-boundaries)
- [CORE-API-001](core.rules.md#core-api-001-must-explicit-api-contracts)

Events with payloads MUST declare typed, validated payload contracts.

Event payload contracts MUST describe the actual event payload, not an incidental wrapper around it.

# HSM-EVENT-002 MUST Treat Events As The Boundary Contract

See:
- [PAT-EVENT-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-event-001-must-typed-event-boundaries)
- [CORE-STATE-001](core.rules.md#core-state-001-must-single-source-of-truth)

The event accepted or emitted by a machine is the boundary contract.

Secondary wrapper contracts, duplicate operation names, and parallel schema registries are forbidden unless that extra object is itself a domain event.

# HSM-COMPLETION-001 MUST Carry Transient Results In Events

See:
- [PAT-ASYNC-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-async-001-must-async-work-return-events)
- [PAT-RTC-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-rtc-001-must-run-to-completion-dispatch)

Short-lived results, classifications, parse outputs, lookup results, activity outputs, and failures MUST move through typed completion or error events.

Machine instance fields, extended state, and caller context values MUST NOT store transient phase data solely to bridge one step to another.

# HSM-CORRELATION-001 MUST Correlate Delayed Results Before Effects

See:
- [PAT-ASYNC-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-async-001-must-async-work-return-events)
- [CORE-STATE-001](core.rules.md#core-state-001-must-single-source-of-truth)

Delayed callbacks, activity completions, external observations, and async results MUST be correlated with the active operation before effects mutate state.

Stale, duplicate, or out-of-order results MUST be ignored, rejected, deferred, or routed explicitly.

# HSM-CHOICE-001 MUST Model Conditional Branching With Choices

See:
- [PAT-HSM-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-hsm-001-must-explicit-hierarchical-state-modeling)

Conditional behavioral branching MUST be modeled with choice states, guarded transitions, or explicit outcome events.

Choice states MUST have a deterministic fallback branch.

# HSM-GUARD-001 MUST Keep Guards Pure

See:
- [PAT-GUARD-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-guard-001-must-pure-guards)

HSM guards MUST be pure predicates.

Guards MUST NOT perform I/O, logging, allocation-heavy work, or state mutation.

# HSM-GUARD-002 MUST Prefer States Over Guards For Action Gating

See:
- [PAT-GUARD-002](patterns.rules.md#pat-guard-002-must-prefer-states-over-guards-for-action-gating)
- [PAT-HSM-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-hsm-001-must-explicit-hierarchical-state-modeling)

Guards MUST only prevent transitions.

States MUST be preferred over guards when preventing actions or selecting which behavior may run.

When multiple transitions from the same source need multiple guards to choose among outcomes or allowed actions, the design MUST introduce an explicit state (or choice with nested states) instead of a multi-guard fan-out.

# HSM-STATE-001 MUST Keep Durable State Machine Owned

See:
- [CORE-STATE-001](core.rules.md#core-state-001-must-single-source-of-truth)

Durable machine data MUST be owned by the machine instance, declared attributes, or explicit runtime data structures.

Caller context values MUST NOT store durable machine state.

# HSM-OWNERSHIP-001 MUST Preserve Instance State Ownership

See:
- [CORE-MEM-001](core.rules.md#core-mem-001-must-explicit-ownership)
- [PAT-ACTOR-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-actor-001-must-actor-state-ownership)

Behavior callbacks MUST mutate machine-private state only through the owning machine's behavior methods, declared attributes, or explicit runtime data structures.

Helpers MAY guard, adapt, or publish, but MUST NOT reach around ownership boundaries to mutate another object or machine's private state.

# HSM-OBS-001 MUST Observe Through Snapshots

See:
- [PAT-SNAPSHOT-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-snapshot-001-must-snapshot-observation)

External code MUST observe HSM state through snapshots or subscriptions.

External code MUST NOT use observed transient states to manually drive internal progression.

# HSM-OPERATIONS-001 MUST Derive Callable Operations From Events

See:
- [PAT-EVENT-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-event-001-must-typed-event-boundaries)
- [CORE-API-001](core.rules.md#core-api-001-must-explicit-api-contracts)

When HSM events are exposed as callable operations, the canonical event MUST remain the source of truth.

Operation aliases MUST be deterministic and collision-checked.

Completion, error, internal lifecycle, and private bookkeeping events MUST NOT become callable operations by default.

# HSM-TIME-001 MUST Model Time Explicitly

See:
- [CORE-BOUND-001](core.rules.md#core-bound-001-must-explicit-platform-boundaries)

HSM behavior MUST NOT call sleeps, timers, wall clocks, or random sources directly.

Time MUST enter through modeled time events, injected clocks, or boundary adapters.

# HSM-ACTIVITY-001 MUST Bound Activities

See:
- [PAT-ASYNC-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-async-001-must-async-work-return-events)

Long-running HSM activities MUST have an owner, cancellation path, and explicit result events.

Short synchronous work SHOULD be modeled as actions rather than activities.

# HSM-DISPATCH-001 MUST Treat Async Dispatch As A Boundary

See:
- [CORE-WORK-001](core.rules.md#core-work-001-must-bounded-runtime-work)

Asynchronous dispatch, set, restart, stop, fanout, and directed dispatch operations MUST expose completion or failure to callers that depend on the result.

Callers MUST use cancellation-aware waits when waiting.

# HSM-CATCHALL-001 SHOULD Keep Catch-All Transitions Lowest Priority

Catch-all transitions SHOULD be lowest priority.

Catch-all transitions MUST NOT accidentally consume internal lifecycle events.

# HSM-TEST-001 MUST Verify Runtime Semantics

See:
- [CORE-TEST-001](core.rules.md#core-test-001-must-deterministic-tests)
- [PAT-RTC-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-rtc-001-must-run-to-completion-dispatch)

Tests MUST exercise runtime behavior for completion, failure, timeout, stale-event, deferred-event, and observer paths when those semantics matter.

Static topology assertions alone are insufficient for behavior claims.

# HSM-NAME-001 MUST Name Domain Artifacts Without HSM Affixes

See:
- [PAT-HSM-001](patterns.rules.md#pat-hsm-001-must-explicit-hierarchical-state-modeling)

New files, variables, classes, types, symbols, and models MUST be named for the domain or lifecycle they represent.

They MUST NOT use `hsm` as a prefix or suffix in any casing or separator form, including `hsm_`, `_hsm`, `Hsm`, `HSM`, `hsmFoo`, `FooHsm`, `foo_hsm`, `hsm-foo`, and `foo-hsm`.

The framework package, import path, or module identity named `hsm` is exempt only when it is the actual HSM library boundary, not a domain artifact name.
